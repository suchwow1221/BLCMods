# This basically just replaces the Delta part of the grenade mod which is responsible for its elemental attribute from Shock to Slag
# Running this mod will remove all the normal Chain Lightnings in the game and will not replace the chain lightning in your inventory / bank due to Sanity Check
# Instead, just use gibbed save editor and paste this code. 
# WARNING: Always run this patch mod before starting the game or the slag chain lightning will disappear.
